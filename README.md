# Week1
This project uses MobileNetV2 to classify animal images efficiently. The Kaggle dataset is analyzed, and a pre-trained model is fine-tuned with extra layers for accuracy. GPU acceleration speeds up training, and transfer learning improves recognition. It has applications in wildlife research, species identification, and AI-driven conservation.
